Implemented NEODatabase.

Class attributes:
    - filename (str): name of the file
    - db (dict): database

Functions:
    - load_data: loads the data from a CSV file
      - keep a set of names added to the database
      - for all rows in the CSV
        - if the name has already been added:
          - create the new Orbit and add it to the
            orbits list of the NEO
        - otherwise:
          - create the new NEO, create the new Orbit
            and add them both to the database.
